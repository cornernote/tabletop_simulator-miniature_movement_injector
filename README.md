![Thumbnail](./workshop/thumbnail.jpg)

Ever wished your miniatures in **Tabletop Simulator** could automatically track movement distances?  
This mod adds exactly that – a simple drag-and-drop way to give any minis a measurement tool!

## 🎮 Features

- **Drag & Drop Injection** – Drop a miniature onto the panel to automatically add the distance-measuring script.
- **Automatic Distance Display** – When you move your mini, it shows how far you've moved on the tabletop grid.
- **Visual Measurement Token** – A temporary spinning marker appears to show starting position while moving.
- **Clean & Lightweight** – The measurement marker automatically deletes itself after a short time.
- **Easy Script Removal** – Flip the panel upside down and drop a miniature to remove the script instantly.
- **Safe Injection** – Won’t overwrite custom scripts unless they're part of this system.
- **Supports Miniatures** – Works with objects tagged as *Miniature, Figurine, Figure,* or *Model*.

## 📝 How to Use

1. Place the **Panel** on your table.
2. Drop a miniature onto the panel:
    - **Right-side up** → Adds the distance script.
    - **Upside down** → Removes the script.
3. Pick up and move your miniature – the distance counter will appear automatically!
